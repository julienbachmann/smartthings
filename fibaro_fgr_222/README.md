# Fibaro FGR 222
Smartthings device handler for Fibaro roller shutter 2.

# Installation
From your smartthings IDE (http://ide.smartthings.com), create a new Device Hanlder and paste this code in `From code` tab.

To install your micro module, disconnect power supply, then wire the micro module to the switch and to the motor. Then before your re-connect the power supply, go to your smartthings app and click on add `Add a Thing` and then re-connect power supply.

The smartthings app should automatically detect the new thing and ask you to set a name. You can also choose the switch type you are using: momentary, toggle or single button.

When you click `done`, wait some seconds and roller shutter will automatically perform a calibration to set max and min boundaries.

You can now use your roller shutter in smartthings app.
